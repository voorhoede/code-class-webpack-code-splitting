# Code Class Webpack code splitting

## Getting started

This project is hosted as a Voorhoede GIT repository. Clone it:

``` bash
$ git clone git@github.com:voorhoede/code-class-webpack-code-splitting.git
```

Install dependencies:

``` bash
$ npm install
```

Start server & watch files:

``` bash
$ npm run start
```

Run `production` mode:

``` bash
$ npm run build-prod
```

Run `none` mode:

``` bash
$ npm run build-none
```

This wil build the project, start the server and start the watcher. The project is available on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The watcher task wil automatically build assets, styles and views. The server will be reloaded on every change.
